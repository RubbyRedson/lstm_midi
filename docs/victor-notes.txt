	- Added dropout. 
	- Added static dictionary
	- Changed so that notes aren't build up by chords but instead are individual chars. 
	- Implemented reading from folder recursively. 
	- Set so that you can easily change so that you don't read in both the _all and each track (you onl want one of them since they are composed of eachother)
	- Fiddled around with parameter so see if you can get around the fact that it seems to converge.
