   Done
   * Read documentation and examples on TFOS, distributed TF, and related concepts
   * Began migration of lstm.py into TFOS-compatible version. Skeleton is in place, but lacking data ingestion
   * Wrote up documentation on learned concepts, gotchas
   * Documented useful resources for further work

   Notes
   Message to Nikita:
    "So far I've made some headway re: conversion to TFOS, but the most critical outstanding part is now ingesting data into the program and converting it as the local impl. does. Included in this is looking into how information and jobs are distributed in both sycnh and asynch training on TFOS, as well as figuring out how it combines weights across machines in both cases"

   TODOS
   Below are taken from tfos.md:
   * Ingest data and populate related structures (dict, reverse_dict, training_data, ...) correctly
   * Look into asynch. vs synch. training for distributed TF and which case is applicable for us. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41293576/distributed-tensorflow-good-example-for-synchronous-training-on-cpus) may be a good resource.
   * Determine HDFS locations of textual MIDI data (may need to upload to Hops first)
   * Store trained model(s) so that we can then run prediction scripts against them to generate "music"

    Done
    * Set up Nik's repo locally, ensured smooth operation
    * Read through sample code & accompanying blog bost
    * Wrote document w/ considerations and implications w.r.t. our project
    * Began investigating TensorFlowOnSpark (TFOS) requirements to get our LSTM up and running

    TODOs
    * Check shared project on Hops
        * Cannot run simple TF job using Hops' TFLauncher
            * Most likely a Python2.7 vs Python3 issue, need to verify what we have installed
    * Document and standardize output format(s) from MIDI parser/transformer
    * Write decoder for output from LSTM back into basic MIDI
